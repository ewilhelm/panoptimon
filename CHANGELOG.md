* collector.rb - make panoptimon available in $RUBYLIB

This allows ruby collectors to access the same library path as the
collector.rb which loaded them (only intended to provide access for
'panoptimon/util'.) This should allow more flexibility with e.g.
bundler.  This approach is rather limited, but maybe simpler than
treating each collector as a standalone executable.

# 0.2.0

Removed the mysql_status collector from core to reduce gem dependencies.
It can now be found at https://github.com/synthesist/panoptimon-collector-mysql_status

# 0.1.0

Added functionality to search for executables in the PATH environment variable directories.
If there a collector named 'thing.json', if it cannot find the 'thing' executable locally
it will search PATH for 'pancollect-thing'.
